## Stable Channels - Version 30MAY2024

This Twitter thread explains the basics, with an example - https://x.com/tonklaus/status/1729567459579945017

And this Delving Bitcoin post goes more in-depth - https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stable-channels-peer-to-peer-dollar-balances-on-lightning

<b>Stable Channels</b> lets Lightning Network node runners keep one side of a Lightning channel balance stable in dollar terms, for example $10,000. 
- These special channels are called <b>Stable Channels</b>. 
- These node runners are called <b>Stable Receivers</b>.
- On the other side of the channel are <b>Stable Providers</b>. 

Stable Providers want to leverage their bitcoin. However, Stable Receivers put their bitcoin at risk by doing so.

Each of these two nodes query 5 price feeds every 5 minutes. Then, based on the new price, they update their channel balance with their counterparty to keep the Stable Receiver stable at $10,000 of bitcoin. 
- Each party remains self-custodial.
- Either party may opt out at any time, either by a cooperative on-chain channel close or forced channel close on-chain. 

This basic process works as follows:

Every 5 minutes, either the price of bitcoin (a) goes up, (b) goes down, or (c) stays the same:
<ul>
<li>(a) If the price of bitcoin goes up:
    <ul>
      <li>the Stable Receiver loses bitcoin. 
      <li>This is because it takes less bitcoin to keep the Stable Receiver stable in dollar terms, so the Stable Receiver pays the Stable Provider. 
    </ul>
<li>(b) If the price of bitcoin goes down:
    <ul>
      <li>the Stable Receiver gets more bitcoin. 
      <li>This is because it takes more bitcoin to keep the Stable Receiver stable in dollar terms, so the Stable Provider pays the Stable Receiver.
    </ul>
<li>(c) the price of bitcoin stays the same:
  <ul>
    <li>nobody needs to do anything
  </ul>
</ul>

Stable Channels are non-routing channels. We are working on adding routing and payments in and out.

Technologically, these are vanilla Lightning channels with no DLCs, and there are no tokens or fiat on-ramps involved.

Stable Channels works as a plug-in on CLN, which is Blockstream's implementation of the Lightning Network specification. 

Stable Channels also works on LND. 

Stable Channels workflows end-to-end work like this:

<ol>
<li>Match with a counterparty and come to an agreement on the parameters of the Stable Channel. 
<li>Select the price feeds. By default, Stable Channels takes the median of five price feeds: BitStamp, CoinGecko, CoinDesk, Coinbase, and Blockchain.info
<li>Create a channel with the counterparty, each putting in the amount of the Stable Channel. 
<ul>
    <li>This can be dual-funded
    <li>Or you can attach the Stable Channel software to an existing channel.
<li> <i>Example: If the Stable Channel is for $10,000, each side of the channel puts in $10,000, for a total channel capacity of $20,000 at the time of channel creation</i>
</ul>
<li>Query the five price feeds' APIs and update the Stable Channel balance accordingly:
<ul>
<li>If the price went down, the Stable Provider needs to pay the Stable Receiver. 
<li>If the price went up, the Stable Receiver needs to pay the Stable Provider.
<li>If the price stayed the same or moved only a tiny amount, no payment is required
<li>Continue until either party wants to close
</ul>
</ol>

## Getting Started

Currently, this works as a CLN plugin and as a standalone LND app. This code is at `/platforms`.

<ul>
    <li>The code for the CLN plugin is at `platforms/stablechannels.py`</li>
    <li>The code for the standalone LND Python app is at `platfornms/lnd.py`.</li>
</ul>

There are also some in-progress iOS apps, web apps, bash scripts, Python servers and other knick-knacks. Check that stuff out, as you wish, in `/platforms`.

### Environment and dependencies

- Terminal access to bitcoind and a CLN node running version `23.05.2` or version `24.02` is required. Other versions may work but `23.08.1` does not work.
- LND is recently supported and is tested with version `0.17.4-beta`
- Python3 is also required. 

For CLN, clone this repo, or create a `stablechannels.py` file with the contents of `stablechannels.py` for CLN. 

Copy the contents of `lnd.py` to a working directory for LND.

Stable Channels has a few dependencies. 
- Either copy the `requirements.txt` file and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- Or: `python3 install` each of the five dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

Stable Channel balance results are written to either `stablelog1.json` if you are the Stable Receiver or `stablelog2.json` if you are the Stable Provider. These are in the `stablechannels` directory inside your network directory, e.g. `~/.lightning/bitcoin/stablechannels/stablelog1.json`.

### Connecting and creating a dual-funded channel (for CLN)

If your Lightning Node is running, you will need to stop your Lightning Node and restart it with the proper commands for dual-funded (or interactive) channels.

You can do this with the following commands.

Stop Lightning: `lightning-cli stop` or `lightning-cli --testnet stop`.

Next, start your CLN node, or modify your config files, to enable dual-funding channels up to the amount you want to stabilize, or leverage. This will look like this

```bash
lightningd --daemon --log-file=/home/ubuntu/cln.log --lightning-dir=/home/ubuntu/lightning --experimental-dual-fund --funder-policy=match --funder-policy-mod=100 --funder-min-their-funding=200000 --funder-per-channel-max=300000 --funder-fuzz-percent=0 --lease-fee-base-sat=2sat --lease-fee-basis=50 --experimental-offers --funder-lease-requests-only=false
```
The "funder" flags instruct CLN on how to handle dual-funded channels. Basically this command is saying: "This node is willing to fund a dual-funded up to **300000** sats, a minimum of **200000** sats, plus some other things not relevant for Stable Channels.  

Your counterparty will need to run a similar command. 

Next connect to your counterparty running the CLN `connect` command. This will look something like: `lightning-cli connect 021051a25e9798698f9baad3e7c815da9d9cc98221a0f63385eb1339bfc637ca81 54.314.42.1`

Now you are ready to dual-fund. This command will look something like `lightning-cli fundchannel 021051a25e9798698f9baad3e7c815da9d9cc98221a0f63385eb1339bfc637ca81 0.0025btc`

If all goes well, we should be returned a txid for the dual-funded channel, and  both parties should have contributed 0.0025btc to the channel. 

Now this needs to be confirmed on the blockchain. 

### Starting Stable Channels

We need to start the Stable Channels plugin with the relevant details of the Stable Channel.

The plugin startup command will look something like this for CLN:

```bash
lightning-cli plugin subcommand=start plugin=/home/clightning/stablechannels.py channel-id=b37a51423e67a1f6733a78bb654535b2b81c427435600b0756bb65e21bdd411a stable-dollar-amount=95 is-stable-receiver=True counterparty=026b9c2a005b182ff5b2a7002a03d6ea9d005d18ed2eb3113852d679b3ec3832c2 native-btc-amount=0
```

Modify the directory for your plugin.

What this command says is: "Start the plugin at this directory. Make the Lightning channel with channel ID b37a51423e67a1f6733a78bb654535b2b81c427435600b0756bb65e21bdd411a a stable channel at $95.00. and 0 sats of BTC. Is is `True` that the node running this command is the Stable Receiver. Here's the ID of the counterparty `026b9c..`."

Your counterparty will need to run a similar command, and the Stable Channels software should do the rest. 

The startup command for the LND plugin will be something like this:

```bash
python3 lnd.py 
    --tls-cert-path=/Users/alice/tls.cert
    --expected-dollar-amount=100 
    --channel-id=137344322632000 
    --is-stable-receiver=false 
    --counterparty=020c66e37461e9f9802e80c16cc0d97151c6da361df450dbca276478dc7d0c271e 
    --macaroon-path=/Users/alice/admin.macaroon 
    --native-amount-sat=0 
    --lnd-server-url=https://127.0.0.1:8082
```

Stable Channel balance results for the Stable Receiver are written to the `stablelog1.json` file  and logs for the Stable Provider are written to the `stablelog2.json` file. 

##  Payout matrix

Assume that we enter into a stable agreement at a price of $27,500 per bitcoin. Each side puts in 1 bitcoin, for a total channel capacity of 2 bitcoin, and a starting USD nominal value of $55,000 total. The below table represents the payouts and percentage change if the bitcoin price increases or decreases by 10%, 20%, or 30%. Check out this payout matrix to better understand the mechanics of the trade agreement.

## Rationale and Challenges

The most valuable stablecoins today are Tether and USDC. These stablecoins hold their value in fiat: cash and bonds. This cash and these bonds have fiat custodians. These fiat custodians are centralized companies that may be forced to freeze these assets or revoke banking access. Either of these scenarios mark a liveness failure of that stablecoin to retain its purchasing power, or worse.

Stable Channels intends to provide a more socially scalable solution. Stable Channels, as a solution, is self-custodial, has no token or token issuer, and intends to give a real-time, streaming finance experience for its users. The vision is to create a self-custodial p2p exchange where users can hedge or lever up their bitcoin exposure.

Stable Channels inherit many of the challenges of the Lightning Network. One challenges is that with Lightning, bitcoin is held in an online wallet. Another challenges is that both nodes must always be online. Yet another challenge is getting trustworthy price feeds. Finally, there are various potential cyber and social engineering attacks.

The Stable Channels approach is that while all of these failure modes and attacks are plausible, it is only by building a USD experience on top of <i>only bitcoin</i> that we can, over the long term, give users the best derivatives trading experience. 

For those users who want USD experience and are Americans, we recommend FDIC-insured bank accounts. For those users who want bitcoin exposure, we recommend simply HODLing spot bitcoin.

### Splicing workflow

Stable Channels can use channel splicing to handle "margin calls."
